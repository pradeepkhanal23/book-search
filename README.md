# Book Search Engine ( Graphql API Conversion)

## Overview

This project is part of the bootcamp curriculum. It involves a conversion of an existing REST API to a GraphQL API. The project demonstrates the transition from a traditional RESTful approach to the more flexible and efficient GraphQL approach.

## Project Description

Originally, this project utilized a RESTful API for handling data and interactions. In this updated version, the API has been converted to use GraphQL. The transition aims to improve data querying efficiency and provide more granular control over the data being requested.

## Key Features

- **GraphQL API**: Implemented GraphQL to replace the previous REST API, allowing for more flexible and efficient data queries.
- **User Authentication**: Integrated user authentication to ensure secure access to the API.
- **Data Operations**: Enabled CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through GraphQL mutations and queries.

## Acknowledgments

- **Bootcamp**: Special thanks to the bootcamp for providing the starter code and guidance throughout the project.
- **GraphQL Documentation**: Utilized the [GraphQL official documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/) for implementation details and best practices.
- **Apollo Client**: Thanks to the [Apollo Client documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for guidance on integrating GraphQL with React.
- **Community**: Appreciation to the developer community for valuable resources and support during the project development.
